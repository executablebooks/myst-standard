# MyST Standard Meta Repository

This is a meta-repository to facilitate discussion, to-do items, and potentially infrastructure and specifications around the MyST Markdown standard.

Currently, it does not have any code, but as we discuss how the MyST specification might be used in different contexts (e.g., outside of Jupyter Book), then it may be a useful place to store implementation-agnostic content (such as schemas or test suites).
